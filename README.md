# iotFan

This Xiot agent is intended to control a fan that offers 3 rotation speeds as well as an oscillation mode.

To use it, you'll preferrably also need the iotinator master module (https://github.com/reivaxy/iotinator), or you can just use it's REST API to integrate to your own designs.

You will find <a href="https://github.com/reivaxy/iotinator/wiki/07.-Dev-environnement-and-debug">here</a> all the information to install your dev environment.


The goal is to transform this 25 year old fan into an iot-equipped fan to control its speed and optional oscillation:

The controls are a bit oldish, hope they'll stand the transformation...

Here is the module prototype, with 4 leds to simulate the 4 static relays that will control the fan speed and oscillation:

And here is the module control panel in the webApp:
