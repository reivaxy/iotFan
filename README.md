# iotFan

This Xiot agent is intended to control a fan that offers 3 rotation speeds as well as an oscillation mode.

To use it, you'll preferrably also need the iotinator master module (https://github.com/reivaxy/iotinator), or you can just use it's REST API to integrate to your own designs.

You will find <a href="https://github.com/reivaxy/iotinator/wiki/07.-Dev-environnement-and-debug">here</a> all the information to install your dev environment.
